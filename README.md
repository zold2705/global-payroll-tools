# Learn These 7 Global Payroll Tools, Complete International Hiring in Five Minutes

Setting up legal entities in every country where you hire drains six-figure budgets and takes months of legal wrangling. Traditional global payroll meant juggling dozens of local providers, reconciling conflicting data across spreadsheets, and hoping compliance documentation stayed current across changing regulations. Modern global employment platforms now consolidate contractor payments, EOR services, and multi-country payroll into unified dashboards that handle onboarding in days instead of quarters. Businesses switching from fragmented systems report cutting administrative time by 60% while reducing compliance risks that previously kept legal teams awake at night.

The platform uses mid-market exchange rates without markup, showing exactly what you pay in fees upfront. This transparency contrasts sharply with banks that hide costs in inflated exchange rates.

The platform unifies pay and HR data in a single system, connecting with trusted global and local payroll partners through certified integrations for 180+ countries. This approach maintains centralized data while leveraging specialized local providers.

Direct payroll processing covers the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, and France. For workers in other countries, pre-built certified integrations reduce deployment time and cost substantially. Bidirectional REST APIs enable third-party systems to flow and query data from Workday easily.

The centralized data management reduces manual collection, validation, and manipulation by entering payroll processing data once and viewing all information in one system. Real-time data flow quickly reflects changes in HR and pay data across Workday and non-Workday payrolls. A consistent security model across HR and payroll ensures users only access data they have permission to view.

Companies like Netflix report streamlined payroll processing across global teams with significantly improved efficiency and employee experience. The platform supports international expansion by allowing payroll launches in multiple countries while meeting unique local requirements.

The robust feature set comes with enterprise-level complexity and pricing. For large organizations with sophisticated needs and resources to implement comprehensive systems, Workday provides institutional-grade capabilities. Smaller businesses typically find the platform overkill for their requirements.

## How do EOR services differ from regular payroll providers?

EOR (Employer of Record) providers become the legal employer in each country, handling contracts, compliance, and liability on your behalf. This lets you hire employees without establishing local entities—critical for testing new markets or hiring individual team members abroad. Regular payroll providers process payments through your existing entities but don't handle employment relationships. EOR services cost more, typically starting around 600€ monthly per employee, but eliminate entity setup costs exceeding $50,000 and 6+ months of legal work.

## What compliance risks exist when paying international contractors?

Misclassification represents the biggest danger—treating employees as contractors to avoid obligations. Tax authorities increasingly scrutinize international arrangements, imposing massive penalties for improper classification. Each country defines employment differently based on factors like control, exclusivity, and economic dependence. Platforms like Lano and Deel generate compliant contractor agreements and provide classification guidance to reduce these risks. Always verify local labor laws rather than assuming one classification works globally.

## Can these platforms handle both contractors and full employees?

Yes, most modern platforms support hybrid workforces. Lano, Deel, and Remote all offer contractor management alongside EOR services and direct payroll. This flexibility lets you choose appropriate employment structures based on needs—contractors for project work, EOR hires for key roles in new markets, and direct employment through owned entities where established. Unified dashboards track all worker types together, providing comprehensive visibility regardless of employment structure.

## Conclusion

International hiring stopped being a luxury reserved for massive corporations with legal departments the moment platforms consolidated compliance, payments, and employment services into accessible interfaces. Testing markets, hiring specialized talent, and building distributed teams now happens in weeks rather than requiring year-long entity establishment projects that drain budgets. [Lano](https://www.lano.io) leads this transformation by unifying EOR services, contractor management, and multi-country payroll into one platform operating across 170+ countries, letting businesses enter new markets in under six months while onboarding employees abroad in under two weeks. The automated workflows and centralized dashboard eliminate the administrative chaos that previously made global expansion feel impossible for growing companies. For teams ready to hire internationally without building massive compliance infrastructure first, this streamlined approach transforms what used to require legal gymnastics into straightforward workforce management.
